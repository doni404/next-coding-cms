# Next.js + Materialize UI v5 + Thirdweb SDK v2
This is an CMS project using reactjs, nextjs, MUI, and thirdweb blockchain SDK. Backend side consuming from Golang API in other repository.
Template bought from themeforest [themeforest.net](https://themeforest.net/item/materialize-material-design-admin-template/11446068#).

This example shows how to use [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/usage/) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/usage/).

## Installation
Go to root path and use yarn with the command below.

```bash
yarn install
```
After the process complete, run development using

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Thirdweb SDK v2
We are connecting to the Blockchain network using Thirdweb SDK [`thirdweb.com`](https://thirdweb.com).
If you have an **existing** project you want to integrate thirdweb into, install the thirdweb SDKs:
```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers
```
